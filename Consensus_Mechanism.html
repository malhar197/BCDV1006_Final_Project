		<h1>Consensus Mechanism</h1>
		<p>
		<b>A Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance - PBFT mechanism</b> is going to be used. This is
		because all nodes and peers in the system are known due to permissioned nature of the
		blockchain. Node count will hardly exceed 20 which have been proven to be highly scalable and
		secure formula in PBFT consensus while having finality. It also does not require significant
		power consumption to reach this consensus.
		<br>
		<br>
		Since the government is the only stakeholder capable of committing data, the consensus
		mechanism will occur intra-firm; that is, participants in consensus mechanism will be all the
		government nodes from which new data can be committed.
