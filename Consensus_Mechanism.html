			<h1>Consensus Mechanism</h1>
			<p>
			<b>A Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance - PBFT mechanism</b> is going to be used. This is
			because all nodes and peers in the system are known due to permissioned nature of the
			blockchain. Node count will hardly exceed 20 which have been proven to be highly scalable and
			secure formula in PBFT consensus while having finality. It also does not require significant
			power consumption to reach this consensus.
			<br>
			<br>
			Since the government is the only stakeholder capable of committing data, the consensus
			mechanism will occur intra-firm; that is, participants in consensus mechanism will be all the
			government nodes from which new data can be committed.
